# guide1_iceTrip

In this HTML & CSS - Introduction assignment I decided to create a small
one page website for a fictional tour/travel agency called IceTrip. The purpose
was to get familiar with the most basic of HTML elements and styling with CSS.
Within the html file I make use of:
* Semantic tags
* Google fonts
* Tags such as div, img, ul
* Flexbox for the main content
* Basic CSS for styling and attempted use of BEM notation
