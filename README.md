# guide1_iceTrip

In this HTML & CSS - Introduction assignment I decided to create a small
one page website for a fictional tour/travel agency called IceTrip. The purpose
was to get familiar with the most basic of HTML elements, styling with CSS and 
getting familiar with the browser's dev-tools.
Within the html file I make use of:
* Semantic tags.
* Google fonts.
* Tags such as div, img, ul.
* Flexbox for the main content.
* Basic CSS for styling and attempted use of BEM notation.

Then last but not least I learned publishing a static website using surge.sh.
The link to it is: telling-lane.surge.sh
